# randomscreenshottool
A multi-platform tool that takes a screenshot of your screen, and sends it to a Discord Webhook. (Personal use only)

# IMPORTANT
Use an IDE and edit the file, replace the place where the Webhook URL goes, with your own URL, if you don't know how to make a Discord Webhook, read this article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks

# Installation
Unzip the program

Open up a Command Prompt or Terminal window

Python 3 or higher is required, download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/

Install the required dependencies

```pip install pyautogui pillow requests```

Next, get into the directory of the tool, if it's in your downloads, you'd do ```cd C:\Users\<user>\Downloads```, or ```cd /users/<user>/downloads``` if you're on macOS.

In order to run it, just type ```python screenshot_webhook.py``` or python3 ```screenshot_webhook.py```

Now, every 1-10 minutes, a screenshot of your desktop will appear in the channel you made the Webhook with.

If you have any ways of optimizing, improving, or adding additional features to this script, just add a commit. I have literally no idea how this code works, because it was made entirely with ChatGPT.
